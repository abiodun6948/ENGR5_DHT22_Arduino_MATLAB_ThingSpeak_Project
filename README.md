# ENGR5_DHT22_Arduino_MATLAB_ThingSpeak_Project
This project teaches how to:  Interface a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor with Arduino.  Read real-time sensor data into MATLAB (desktop or online).  Visualize the data using live animated plots.  Send the readings to a ThingSpeak IoT dashboard.  Manage and share the code using GitHub.
This repository contains all code and setup files for interfacing a DHT22 sensor with Arduino, reading data into MATLAB, plotting live graphs, and uploading to ThingSpeak.

## Folders
- **Arduino/**: Contains Arduino sketch
- **MATLAB/**: MATLAB scripts for serial read, plotting, and ThingSpeak upload
- **Docs/**: Guides for GitHub and project setup

## Learning Objectives
- Use MATLAB to acquire and visualize live IoT data
- Interface Arduino sensors with MATLAB
- Send sensor data to the cloud via ThingSpeak
- Version control with GitHub
